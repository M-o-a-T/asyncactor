                        non-UTF8-encoded strings (this violates the
                        MsgPack specification).
      ``use_list``: if ``True``, lists and tuples are returned as lists
                    (i.e. modifyable). Defaults to ``False``, which uses
                    immutable tuples (this is faster).
